<h1>Projects while learning how to code with C</h1>
This is a folder that shows my progress in learning the C language.<br />

<!-- <h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube:](https://www.youtube.com) -->

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

- Visual Studio Code

<h2>Project Lists </h2>

- <b>hello.c</b>
  - Your well known introduction for "Hello, World!"
- <b>population.c</b>
  - Calculates the number of years required for the population to grow from the start size to the end size and generates "n" where "n" is number of years.
  - Minimal population number cannot be less than 9 (to prevent stagnation) and end size population cannot be less than starting population.
- <b>scrabble.c</b>
  - Created a short scrabble-like game where two players would each enter their words. The highest scoring player wins.
  - Program stores the point values of each letter in the alphabet in an integer array. Non alphabet characters are scored 0 and it is not case-sensitive. Program will then indicate which player wins.
- <b>readability.c</b>
  - This one is a bit unique! This code uses a Coleman-Liau index of text which identifies the "Grade Level" per say of a string of text.
  - Program will prompt for a string of text, which then counts the number of letters, words and sentences. The code will then print "Grade X" where X is the grade level computed using the Coleman-Liau formula, to the nearest integer.
- <b>caesar.c</b>
  - This code is designed to prompt a user for a string of text and will generate an output the original text to cipher text.
  - Program will prompt user for a string of text 'plaintext' and outputs a 'ciphertext'. It will preserve the capitalized letters even while rotating through the ASCII table.
- <b>bulbs.c</b>
  - This one is my favorite so far. This is designed to take a message and converts the message to binary codes, which is represented by lightbulbs!
  - Program will prompt a user for a text which then converts the text to a series of 8-bit binary numbers, for each character string. Instead of 0s and 1s, it is represented with a yellowlight bulb (on) and a black lightbulb for (off). Each byte of 8 lightbulbs are printed on its own line.
